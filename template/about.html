We support research by providing platforms on which intellectual discussions can be made The society is working on establishing a center for innovation and excellence. To this effect, properties have been acquired to build laboratories. The goal is for students to be able to run experiments for research purposes at extremely low costs. This will facilitate the development of Science and Technology for intelligent but needy students. Experts in specific fields shall be invited to teach/give teleconferences in these areas. For example, the use of open-path Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry to detect chemical warfare agents involves combined knowledge in vibrational spectroscopy and chemometrics. Specialized areas like these that will be great for our law enforcement agencies including the military, police service, fire service, etc will involve inviting experts from around the world to deliver lectures.</p>
        <p><span class="abc">(B)</span> Academic and Business Conferences Conferences are organized yearly . These will be formal events where researchers present results, showcase workshops, and other activities and also businesses discussing technical and/or business-related matters.
